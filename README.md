# Modern Calculator

This is a simple, yet modern and visually appealing calculator built using Python and the Tkinter library.

It's designed with a dark theme for a sleek, contemporary feel.

## Features

- **Basic Arithmetic**: Perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.
- **Clear Function**: Reset the input field with the "C" button.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts well to different screen sizes.
- **Sleek Dark Theme**: A modern, minimalistic look with clean fonts and smooth button interactions.
- **Easy to Use**: A simple and intuitive GUI with large buttons for easy tapping.
